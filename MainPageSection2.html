                <p><br />Every stake holder is the most important visitor to our campus. He is not dependent on us. We are dependent on him. His visit is not interruption in our work. He is purpose of it. We are not doing favour by serving him. He is doing a favour by giving us the opportunity to do so. He is not outsider in our mission, he is part of it.</p>
